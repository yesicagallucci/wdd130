      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Since we moved to Paraguay over two years ago we've been using a Home biogas which saved us a lot of money because we don't need to buy any gas bottle. We want to share our eperience using Home biogas and feeding him mostly with mangoes in the spring/summer season.  </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Other foreigners living in Paraguay and people who are dedicated to growing plants and food. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        We are Walter and Yesica, we are from Buenos Aires, Argentina but two and a half years ago, in mid-2021, we moved to Caacupe, Paraguay. This move involved many changes in our lifestyle, we went from living in one of the largest cities in the world to a city of 50,000 inhabitants that is located more than 50 km from the country's capital. Another important change was having access to a backyard, a lot of land, and trees in our house, knowing this since we started planning our move a year before we dreamed of having a household biogas digester system. <br> The options for cooking here are packaged gas, electric hob, brazier, and grill we were not used to cooking with a brazier, so we knew that we were going to use electricity to cook, but we thought that biogas could be a solution to not spend money on bottled gas, spoiler alert: we were right!<br>
We arrived in Caacupe between April and May 2021 with our cat Totoro, who was 12 years old at the time. to be able to move, and due to the pandemic we had to sell 95% of our things and it was with part of that money that we were able to buy the biodigester, at that time it was convenient for us to buy it from Argentina, but we bought it while living in Paraguay and they sent it by order by a bus company. We received it at the end of May 2021.
We installed it right away but it took a few months to give us gas continuously because we were in the fall-winter season.<br>
But the main reason for this website, or its reason for being, is to tell you what a household biogas digester system is, how it works, and its benefits.
This site from Argentina's government says about what a biodigester is and does: <br>
"A biodigester is a container or tank (hermetically closed) that is loaded with organic waste. Inside, the decomposition of organic matter occurs to generate biogas, a fuel with which you can cook, heat water and produce electrical energy, using a gas generator. The residue from this process, formed by effluent and sludge, is used as a biofertilizer."
https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ambiente/accion/biodigestores#:~:text=Un%20biodigestor%20es%20un%20recipiente,mediante%20un%20generador%20a%20gas.
<br>Our biodigester is from Homebiogas (https://homebiogas.com/)  but I think there are other brands out there. It's like having a big stomach in the backyard and feeding it with kitchen residues and other organic waste. 
to make it start you have to put cow or horse manure in it, so it develops the bacteria needed to start the process, after a few days or weeks I'm not sure, because it took a few months for us because of winter to start producing gas.
By the time the heat began and the biodigester began to produce gas, the mango season also began. <br>In the area where we live, there are many mango trees, every house has at least one, and they are also on public roads. In our house, there are two huge ones, and it is very difficult to harvest the mangoes because they are very high, so most end up on the ground bitten by birds or burst, all those mangoes feed the biodigester from November to February more or less, and That's why we say is mango biogas.

      <h3>Cooking with Mango Gas</h3>
      <p>
        You would think that the gas smells bad but the device includes filters so that the bad smell does not reach the stove. However, once our useful life was over, we did not replace it, so we did experience a bit of a bad smell when using the stove, but the smell does not transfer to the food, and it can be used without problems for cooking.
It works like a common burner connected to a gas bottle or a normal gas connection. The stored gas powers a high flame for one hour and a medium-low flame for three hours.
It is not enough gas to be the only source of cooking energy available, but it is a great complement to the electric stove or brazier.
It is especially useful for long, low-flame cooking, such as stew, "locro", or jams. It is more efficient if combined with utensils that help shorten cooking times such as a pressure cooker.
We use it for cooking mostly outside, but it can be used inside as well. Generally, we have it right outside the kitchen, but we plan at some point to build an external kitchen where it is more comfortable to use since we lack a surface to support the utensils we are using while cooking.

      </ul>
      <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to the gas we use for cooking, the biodigester gives us a very useful byproduct, a very powerful, concentrated, and super nutritious fertilizer. The fertilizer is a liquid that comes out from the end opposite the mouth of the device and we collect it in a bucket to which we put a little tap to make it easier to package it. A while ago we sold it in one-liter bottles, then we started offering it for free, now we are using it in our bananas and garden and we hope to soon package it in 5-liter drums to sell it again.
To use this fertilizer you must dilute it in 5 parts of water. For example, if you separate 1 liter of fertilizer, you add 5 liters of water. This is very important because it is very concentrated and using it pure can be counterproductive for the plants and ruin them.
To use it at home we use a 10 liter watering can to which we directly add part of the fertilizer and water to dilute it.
We started the garden too recently to say if it helped or not, plus we are in a week of a lot of rain so that may be what is helping the garden too, but I can assure you that our bananas are much better since they received the fertilizer, when we arrived 2 and a half years ago the bananas did not grow any bunches until the end of the year. and now we have 5 bunches growing at the same time and a banana that in these almost 3 years did not give anything is growing a bunch
