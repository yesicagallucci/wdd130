                We are Walter and Yesica, we are from Buenos Aires, Argentina but two and a half years ago, in mid-2021, we moved to Caacupe, Paraguay. This move involved many changes in our lifestyle, we went from living in one of the largest cities in the world to a city of 50,000 inhabitants that is located more than 50 km from the country's capital. Another important change was having access to a backyard, a lot of land, and trees in our house, knowing this since we started planning our move a year before we dreamed of having a household biogas digester system. <br> The options for cooking here are packaged gas, electric hob, brazier, and grill we were not used to cooking with a brazier, so we knew that we were going to use electricity to cook, but we thought that biogas could be a solution to not spend money on bottled gas, spoiler alert: we were right!<br>
                We arrived in Caacupe between April and May 2021 with our cat Totoro, who was 12 years old at the time. to be able to move, and due to the pandemic we had to sell 95% of our things and it was with part of that money that we were able to buy the biodigester, at that time it was convenient for us to buy it from Argentina, but we bought it while living in Paraguay and they sent it by order by a bus company. We received it at the end of May 2021.
                We installed it right away but it took a few months to give us gas continuously because we were in the fall-winter season.<br>

            <p> But the main reason for this website, or its reason for being, is to tell you what a household biogas digester system is, how it works, and its benefits.
              <a href="https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ambiente/accion/biodigestores#:~:text=Un%20biodigestor%20es%20un%20recipiente,mediante%20un%20generador%20a%20gas." target="_blank">This</a> site from Argentina's government says about what a biodigester is and does: <br>
              "A biodigester is a container or tank (hermetically closed) that is loaded with organic waste. Inside, the decomposition of organic matter occurs to generate biogas, a fuel with which you can cook, heat water and produce electrical energy, using a gas generator. The residue from this process, formed by effluent and sludge, is used as a biofertilizer."            
              <br>Our biodigester is from<a href="https://homebiogas.com/" target="_blank"> Homebiogas</a> but I think there are other brands out there. It's like having a big stomach in the backyard and feeding it with kitchen residues and other organic waste. 
              to make it start you have to put cow or horse manure in it, so it develops the bacteria needed to start the process, after a few days or weeks I'm not sure, because it took a few months for us because of winter to start producing gas.

           <p>By the time the heat began and the biodigester began to produce gas, the mango season also began. <br>In the area where we live, there are many mango trees, every house has at least one, and they are also on public roads. In our house, there are two huge ones, and it is very difficult to harvest the mangoes because they are very high, so most end up on the ground bitten by birds or burst, all those mangoes feed the biodigester from November to February more or less, and That's why we say is mango biogas.</p>
