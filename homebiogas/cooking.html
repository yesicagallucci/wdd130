            <p>
               You would think that the gas smells bad but the device includes filters so that the bad smell does not reach the stove. However, once its useful life was over, we did not replace it, so we did experience a bit of a bad smell when using the stove, but the smell does not transfer to the food, and it can be used without problems for cooking.
               It works like a common burner connected to a gas bottle or a normal gas connection. The stored gas powers a high flame for one hour and a medium-low flame for three hours.
               It is not enough gas to be the only source of cooking energy available, but it is a great complement to the electric stove or brazier.
               It is especially useful for long, low-flame cooking, such as stew, "locro", or jams. It is more efficient if combined with utensils that help shorten cooking times such as a pressure cooker.
               We use it for cooking mostly outside, but it can be used inside as well. Generally, we have it right outside the kitchen, but we plan at some point to build an external kitchen where it is more comfortable to use since we lack a surface to support the utensils we are using while cooking.
