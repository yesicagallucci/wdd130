    <p>My name is Yesica, I am from Buenos Aires, Argentina, but two years ago I moved to Paraguay. I live with my husband, our 14 year-old cat and two recently adopted kittens. </p>
    <p>I learned some HTML and CSS in COMM 310 as part of my Graphic design fundammentals certificate and I have been learning a little more following the responsive web design certification from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a> I still have to finish it, but I hope to keep learning HTML and CSS in this class.</p>
    <p>Please, excuse my grammar, but as far as I know vscode do not support Grammarly :P </p>
